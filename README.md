# ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, Iâ€™m Ricardo!

- Aside from coding Iâ€™m heavily into gaming and hardware tinkering, especially modding game consoles and home server stuff.
- After having gone through the basics Iâ€™m currently learning about Frontend technologies, as of now I'm building projects with React and picking up some CSS frameworks along the way.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything I can, doing my best to be a good Open Source contributor.
- You can reach me on ðŸ“« ricardo.christmann@protonmail.com
